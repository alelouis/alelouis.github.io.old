**Bagging**: train n models on randomly chosen subsamples of data and taking mean prediction.
**Boosting**: sequentially train from weak classifiers strong boosted models with data weight updates, take weighted average for prediction
**Bootstrap**: inference statistical technique consiting in resampling original data to infer statistics. Can be used in ML context, sub sampling datasets to aggregate different prediction. Bootstrap + aggreation = bagging≈ì:
