<p><strong>Bagging</strong>: train n models on randomly chosen subsamples of data and taking mean prediction.
<strong>Boosting</strong>: sequentially train from weak classifiers strong boosted models with data weight updates, take weighted average for prediction
<strong>Bootstrap</strong>: inference statistical technique consiting in resampling original data to infer statistics. Can be used in ML context, sub sampling datasets to aggregate different prediction. Bootstrap + aggreation = bagging≈ì:</p>
