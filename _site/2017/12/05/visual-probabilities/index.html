<h2 id="joint-marginal-and-conditional-probabilities-visualized">Joint, marginal and conditional, probabilities visualized</h2>

<p>Being a visual type of person (if that’s actually a thing), I like thinking about concept visualy. It’s not rare to have many interpretations of the same concepts and each one of us choose a mental model that suits us the best when learning new things.</p>

<p>I remember struggling to get my visual mental models right about probabiliy densities at first. While this is not typically the way it is teached, I find it easier to mentally understand and anticipate probability mechanics by visual means. I share here a graphical approach for theses concepts :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Joint probability density : <script type="math/tex">p(x, \theta)</script></li>
  <li>Marginal density : <script type="math/tex">p(x)</script></li>
  <li>Conditional density : <script type="math/tex">p(x\mid \theta)</script></li>
  <li>Likelihood : <script type="math/tex">L(\theta\mid x)</script></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="joint-probability-density">Joint probability density</h2>
<p>Joint distribution describre co-occurence of events. In terms of continuous distributions they are often noted as follow :</p>

<p><img style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width : 100%;" src="../images/visual_prob/joint.svg" /></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p(x,\theta)</script>

<p>That is the distribution describing the joint probability of random variables <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>. For univariate RV <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>, the bivariate joint density <script type="math/tex">p(x,\theta)</script> can be represented as a surface (see fig.1). Integrating a joint distribution on the whole domains of definition of its variables gives one.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\iint p(x,\theta)\;dxd\theta= 1</script>

<p>We can fix any of the random variables and see the behavior of the other variables by <strong>slicing</strong> the joint distribution (red and blue lines).
Note that <script type="math/tex">p(x=0,\theta)</script> and <script type="math/tex">p(x,\theta=0)</script> are not probability densities as they don’t integrate to 1.</p>

<p><img style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width : 60%;" src="../images/visual_prob/joint_slices.svg" /></p>

<p>The whole shape of the curve is nonetheless interesting as we will see in conditional densities part.
If we were to integrate either of those curves it would give us the <strong>marginal</strong> probabilities of the fixed parameters at the fixed value. For instance :</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p(x=0) = \int p(x=0,\theta)\;d\theta</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p(\theta=0) = \int p(x,\theta=0)\;dx</script>

<p>We saw here a glimpse of what actually are marginal probabilities which are developed in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="marginal-density">Marginal density</h2>
<p>A marginal density represents the density of a unique random variable.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p(x), p(\theta)</script>

<p>In case where the marginal is not specified, we can (in theory) fully recover it from the joint density. As noted earlier, integrating a slice of joint density at a given point equals the marginal at the very same point. The whole marginal density can be computed in a similar fashion. By taking many slices over a parameter and calculating the corresponding integral, we recover for each <script type="math/tex">x</script> value the corresponding area value / marginal value.</p>

<p><img style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width : 100%;" src="../images/visual_prob/integration_marginal.svg" /></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p(x) = \int p(x,\theta)\;d\theta</script>

<p>On the above graph are drawn many <script type="math/tex">p(x=k,\theta)</script> which once integrated / marginalized w.r.t <script type="math/tex">\theta</script> equals <script type="math/tex">p(x=k)</script>. If we were to plot <script type="math/tex">p(x=k)</script> for infinitesimal <script type="math/tex">k</script> values we would obtain <script type="math/tex">p(x)</script> :</p>

<p>GRAPH</p>

<p>Some properties appear obvious while reasoning geometrically :</p>
<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">p(x)</script> integrates to one as integrating over all the slices effectively integrates the whole joint density.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">p(x)</script> doesn’t depend on any other variable, as they have been <strong>integrated</strong> into the marginal.</li>
  <li><em>Caution</em> : <script type="math/tex">p(x)</script> computation seems straight forward geometrically but can actually be intractable analytically (and hard numerically too).</li>
</ul>
