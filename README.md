# alelouis.github.io
Personal blog where I write about music, math and other fun things.

## Use
The script `dev.sh` launches a docker container with Jekyll and all dependencies gems on port 4000.  
The `alelouis/blog` image is pulled from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/alelouis/blog) and is, hopefully, up to date.
